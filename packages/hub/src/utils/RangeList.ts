/**
 * Code generated with this prompt by Cursor:
 *
 * I want to build a class to manage ranges
 *
 * I can add ranges to it with a start& an end (both integer, end > start). It should store those ranges efficently.
 *
 * When several ranges overlap, eg [1, 100] and [30, 50], I want the class to split the range into non-overlapping ranges, and add a "ref counter" to the ranges. For example,  [1, 30], [30, 50] * 2, [50, 100]
 *
 * I also want to be able to remove ranges, it will decrease the ref counter or remove the range altogether. I can only remove ranges at existing boundaries. For example, with the [1, 30], [30, 50] * 2, [50, 100] configuration
 *
 * - removing [1, 100] => the only range remaning is [30, 50]
 * - removing [2, 50] => error, because "2' is not a boundary
 * - removing [30, 50] => [1, 30], [30, 50], [50, 100] (do not "merge" the ranges back together)
 *
 * I want to be able to associate data to each range. And I want to be able to get the ranges inside boundaries. For example , with [1, 30], [30, 50] * 2, [50, 100] configuration
 *
 * - getting [30, 100] => I receive [30, 50] * 2, [50, 100], and I can get / modify the data assocaited to each range by accessing their data prop. Note the "*2" is just the ref counter, there is onlly one range object for the interval returned
 * - getting [2, 50] => I get [30, 50] * 2
 *
 * ----
 *
 * Could optimize with binary search, but the ranges we want to handle are not that many.
