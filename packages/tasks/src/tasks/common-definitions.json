					"type": "number",
					"description": " Local typicality measures how similar the conditional probability of predicting a target token next is to the expected conditional probability of predicting a random token next, given the partial text already generated. If set to float < 1, the smallest set of the most locally typical tokens with probabilities that add up to typical_p or higher are kept for generation. See [this paper](https://hf.co/papers/2202.00666) for more details."

				"eta_cutoff": {
					"type": "number",
					"description": "Eta sampling is a hybrid of locally typical sampling and epsilon sampling. If set to float strictly between 0 and 1, a token is only considered if it is greater than either eta_cutoff or sqrt(eta_cutoff) * exp(-entropy(softmax(next_token_logits))). The latter term is intuitively the expected next token probability, scaled by sqrt(eta_cutoff). In the paper, suggested values range from 3e-4 to 2e-3, depending on the size of the model. See [Truncation Sampling as Language Model Desmoothing](https://hf.co/papers/2210.15191) for more details."
