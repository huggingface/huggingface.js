This task covers guides on both [text-generation](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-generation&sort=downloads) and [text-to-text generation](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text2text-generation&sort=downloads) models. Popular large language models that are used for chats or following instructions are also covered in this task. You can find the list of selected open-source large language models [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard), ranked by their performance scores.

## Use Cases

### Instruction Models

A model trained for text generation can be later adapted to follow instructions. You can try some of the most powerful instruction-tuned open-access models like Mixtral 8x7B, Cohere Command R+, and Meta Llama3 70B [at Hugging Chat](https://huggingface.co/chat).

### Code Generation

A Text Generation model, also known as a causal language model, can be trained on code from scratch to help the programmers in their repetitive coding tasks. One of the most popular open-source models for code generation is StarCoder, which can generate code in 80+ languages. You can try it [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/bigcode/bigcode-playground).

### Stories Generation

A story generation model can receive an input like "Once upon a time" and proceed to create a story-like text based on those first words. You can try [this application](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mosaicml/mpt-7b-storywriter) which contains a model trained on story generation, by MosaicML.

If your generative model training data is different than your use case, you can train a causal language model from scratch. Learn how to do it in the free transformers [course](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter7/6?fw=pt)!

## Task Variants

### Completion Generation Models

A popular variant of Text Generation models predicts the next word given a bunch of words. Word by word a longer text is formed that results in for example:

- Given an incomplete sentence, complete it.
- Continue a story given the first sentences.
- Provided a code description, generate the code.

The most popular models for this task are GPT-based models, [Mistral](mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1) or [Llama series](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf). These models are trained on data that has no labels, so you just need plain text to train your own model. You can train text generation models to generate a wide variety of documents, from code to stories.

### Text-to-Text Generation Models

These models are trained to learn the mapping between a pair of texts (e.g. translation from one language to another). The most popular variants of these models are [NLLB](facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M), [FLAN-T5](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-xxl), and [BART](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/bart). Text-to-Text models are trained with multi-tasking capabilities, they can accomplish a wide range of tasks, including summarization, translation, and text classification.

## Language Model Variants

When it comes to text generation, the underlying language model can come in several types:

- **Base models:** refers to plain language models like [Mistral 7B](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.3) and [Meta Llama-3-70b](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B). These models are good for fine-tuning and few-shot prompting.

- **Instruction-trained models:** these models are trained in a multi-task manner to follow a broad range of instructions like "Write me a recipe for chocolate cake". Models like [Qwen 2 7B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2-7B-Instruct), [Yi 1.5 34B Chat](https://huggingface.co/01-ai/Yi-1.5-34B-Chat), and [Meta Llama 70B Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct) are examples of instruction-trained models. In general, instruction-trained models will produce better responses to instructions than base models.

- **Human feedback models:** these models extend base and instruction-trained models by incorporating human feedback that rates the quality of the generated text according to criteria like [helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00861). The human feedback is then combined with an optimization technique like reinforcement learning to align the original model to be closer with human preferences. The overall methodology is often called [Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback](https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf), or RLHF for short. [Zephyr ORPO 141B A35B](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-orpo-141b-A35b-v0.1) is an open-source model aligned through human feedback.

## Text Generation from Image and Text

There are language models that can input both text and image and output text, called vision language models. [IDEFICS 2](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceM4/idefics2-8b) and [MiniCPM Llama3 V](https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5) are good examples. They accept the same generation parameters as other language models. However, since they also take images as input, you have to use them with the `image-to-text` pipeline. You can find more information about this in the [image-to-text task page](https://huggingface.co/tasks/image-to-text).

## Inference

You can use the ðŸ¤— Transformers library `text-generation` pipeline to do inference with Text Generation models. It takes an incomplete text and returns multiple outputs with which the text can be completed.

```python
from transformers import pipeline
generator = pipeline('text-generation', model = 'HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta')
generator("Hello, I'm a language model", max_length = 30, num_return_sequences=3)
## [{'generated_text': "Hello, I'm a language modeler. So while writing this, when I went out to meet my wife or come home she told me that my"},
##  {'generated_text': "Hello, I'm a language modeler. I write and maintain software in Python. I love to code, and that includes coding things that require writing"}, ...
```

[Text-to-Text generation models](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text2text-generation&sort=downloads) have a separate pipeline called `text2text-generation`. This pipeline takes an input containing the sentence including the task and returns the output of the accomplished task.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

text2text_generator = pipeline("text2text-generation")
text2text_generator("question: What is 42 ? context: 42 is the answer to life, the universe and everything")
[{'generated_text': 'the answer to life, the universe and everything'}]

text2text_generator("translate from English to French: I'm very happy")
[{'generated_text': 'Je suis trÃ¨s heureux'}]
```

You can use [huggingface.js](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface.js) to infer text classification models on Hugging Face Hub.

```javascript
import { InferenceClient } from "@huggingface/inference";

const inference = new InferenceClient(HF_TOKEN);
await inference.conversational({
	model: "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english",
	inputs: "I love this movie!",
});
```

##Â Text Generation Inference

[Text Generation Inference (TGI)](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference) is an open-source toolkit for serving LLMs tackling challenges such as response time. TGI powers inference solutions like [Inference Endpoints](https://huggingface.co/inference-endpoints) and [Hugging Chat](https://huggingface.co/chat/), as well as multiple community projects. You can use it to deploy any supported open-source large language model of your choice.
