## Use Cases

Image-to-video models transform a static image into a video sequence. This can be used for a variety of creative and practical applications.

### Animated Images

Bring still photos to life by adding subtle motion or creating short animated clips. This is great for social media content or dynamic presentations.

### Storytelling from a Single Frame

Expand on the narrative of an image by generating a short video that imagines what happened before or after the moment captured in the photo.

### Video Generation with Visual Consistency

Use an input image as a strong visual anchor to guide the generation of a video, ensuring that the style, characters, or objects in the video remain consistent with the source image.

## Task Variants

Image-to-video models can have variants based on the specific type of transformation or control offered.

### Controllable Motion

Some models might allow users to specify the direction or intensity of motion, giving more fine-grained control over the generated animation.

### Loopable Videos

Models can be designed to create seamlessly looping videos, perfect for backgrounds or short, endlessly watchable clips.
