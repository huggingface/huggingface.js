## Audio Text to Text

The Audio Text to Text task (also sometimes referred to as speech-to-text, speech recognition, or speech translation depending on the specifics) converts audio input into textual output. This is a versatile task that can be used for various applications.

### Use Cases

*   **Speech Recognition:** Transcribing spoken language from an audio clip into text. This is foundational for voice assistants, dictation software, and transcribing meetings or interviews.
*   **Speech Translation:** Directly translating spoken language from an audio clip in one language into text in another language. This is useful for real-time translation applications or translating audio content.
*   **Voice Command Interfaces:** Converting spoken commands into text that can then be interpreted by a system to perform actions (e.g., "Play music," "Set a timer").
*   **Audio Event Description/Captioning:** Generating textual descriptions of sounds or events occurring in an audio stream (though this might sometimes overlap with Audio Tagging).

### Python Examples

You can use the `transformers` library for many audio-text-to-text tasks.

**1. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR):**

```python
from transformers import pipeline
import torchaudio

# Initialize the ASR pipeline
# Replace "openai/whisper-base" with any ASR model of your choice
asr_pipeline = pipeline("automatic-speech-recognition", model="openai/whisper-base")

# Load an example audio file (you'll need to have one)
# For example, using torchaudio to load and resample if needed
# waveform, sample_rate = torchaudio.load("your_audio_file.wav")
# if sample_rate != asr_pipeline.feature_extractor.sampling_rate:
#    resampler = torchaudio.transforms.Resample(orig_freq=sample_rate, new_freq=asr_pipeline.feature_extractor.sampling_rate)
#    waveform = resampler(waveform)

# Or provide a path directly (ensure it's in a supported format and sample rate)
# For demonstration, let's assume you have a file "sample_audio.flac"
# If you don't have an audio file handy, you can skip loading and pass dummy data or a public URL if the model supports it.
# For local files, it's usually best to load them as numpy arrays or torch tensors.

# Example with a local file path (ensure the file exists and is accessible)
# text_output = asr_pipeline("path/to/your/sample_audio.flac")
# print(text_output)
# Expected output: {'text': 'TRANSCRIPTION OF THE AUDIO...'}

# Example with a publicly accessible URL (model/pipeline must support it)
# text_output_url = asr_pipeline("https://huggingface.co/datasets/Narsil/asr_dummy/resolve/main/1.flac")
# print(text_output_url)
# Expected output: {'text': ' HELLO MY NAME IS NARSEEL'}
```
*Note: For local audio files, you might need to load and preprocess them into the format expected by the pipeline (e.g., a NumPy array or Torch tensor of raw audio samples). Ensure the sampling rate matches the model's requirements.*

**2. Speech Translation (Example with a model fine-tuned for S2T):**
Speech-to-Text (S2T) models can directly translate audio from one language to text in another.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Initialize the speech-to-text translation pipeline
# Replace "facebook/s2t-small-librispeech-asr" with a speech translation model
# For example, if you want to translate English audio to French text:
translator_pipeline = pipeline("automatic-speech-recognition", model="facebook/s2t-small-en-fr-st") # Example model

# Process an audio file (similar to ASR)
# audio_input = "path/to/your/english_audio.wav"
# translated_text = translator_pipeline(audio_input)
# print(translated_text)
# Expected output: {'text': 'FRENCH TRANSLATION OF THE AUDIO...'}

# Example with a publicly accessible URL (model/pipeline must support it)
# For S2T, ensure the audio is in the source language the model expects.
# This example uses an ASR model URL, adapt if a direct S2T URL is available.
# translated_text_url = translator_pipeline("https://huggingface.co/datasets/Narsil/asr_dummy/resolve/main/1.flac") # Assuming English audio
# print(translated_text_url)
# Expected output: {'text': 'BONJOUR MON NOM EST NARSEEL'} (if input was "Hello my name is Narsil")
```

### JavaScript Example

You can use [`@huggingface/inference`](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface.js) to perform audio-text-to-text tasks with models on the Hugging Face Hub.

```javascript
import { InferenceClient } from "@huggingface/inference";

const inference = new InferenceClient(HF_TOKEN); // Your Hugging Face token

async function transcribeAudio(audioBlob) {
  try {
    const result = await inference.automaticSpeechRecognition({
      model: "openai/whisper-base", // Or your preferred ASR/S2T model
      data: audioBlob,
    });
    console.log(result.text);
    return result.text;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error during transcription:", error);
  }
}

// Example usage:
// Assumes you have an audio file as a Blob object (e.g., from a file input)
// const audioFile = new File(["...audio data..."], "audio.wav", { type: "audio/wav" });
// transcribeAudio(audioFile);

// Example fetching a remote audio file and then transcribing:
async function transcribeRemoteAudio(audioUrl) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(audioUrl);
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }
    const audioBlob = await response.blob();
    
    const result = await inference.automaticSpeechRecognition({
      model: "openai/whisper-base", // Or your preferred ASR/S2T model
      data: audioBlob,
    });
    console.log("Transcription:", result.text);
    return result.text;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error during remote audio transcription:", error);
  }
}

// transcribeRemoteAudio("httpsS://huggingface.co/datasets/Narsil/asr_dummy/resolve/main/1.flac");
