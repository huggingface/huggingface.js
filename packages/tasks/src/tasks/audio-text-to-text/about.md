## Different Types of Audio-Text-to-Text Models

Audio-text-to-text models can be categorized into two main types:

- **Base:**  
  Pre-trained models that extract rich audio features using techniques such as Wav2Vec, HuBERT, or Whisper. These models serve as the backbone for various downstream tasks. An example is the [Qwen2-Audio-7b](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2-Audio-7B), which can be further fine-tuned.

- **Instruction:**  
  Base models fine-tuned on specialized audio instruction datasets to better handle task-specific querie and conversation. For instance, [Ichigo-llama3.1-s-instruct-v0.4](https://huggingface.co/homebrewltd/Ichigo-llama3.1-s-instruct-v0.4) has been optimized to follow detailed audio-related commands.

### Use Cases

- **Multimodal Audio Dialogue:**  
  These models can engage in real-time, multi-turn conversations by processing audio inputs and generating text responses. They are the backbone of advanced voice assistants and interactive dialogue systems.

- **Speech Transcription and Analysis:**  
  Beyond converting spoken words to text, these models capture prosody, emotion, and speaker characteristics. This enriched transcription can be used for applications such as sentiment analysis and speaker profiling.

- **Audio Question Answering:**  
  By directly processing audio inputs, the models can answer questions about the content of an audio clip—whether it’s a podcast excerpt or a recorded conversation.
